    """
    Manager inheritance is a pretty complex topic which may need
    more thought regarding how this should be handled for polymorphic
    models.

    In any case, we probably should propagate 'objects' and 'base_objects'
    from PolymorphicModel to every subclass. We also want to somehow
    inherit/propagate _default_manager as well, as it needs to be polymorphic.

    The current implementation below is an experiment to solve this
    problem with a very simplistic approach: We unconditionally
    inherit/propagate any and all managers (using _copy_to_model),
    as long as they are defined on polymorphic models
    (the others are left alone).

    Like Django ModelBase, we special-case _default_manager:
    if there are any user-defined managers, it is set to the first of these.

    We also require that _default_manager as well as any user defined
    polymorphic managers produce querysets that are derived from
    PolymorphicQuerySet.
